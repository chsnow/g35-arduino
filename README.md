g35-arduino
===========

Arduino control software for GE G-35 LED christmas lights.

THIS CODE IS __UGLY__ AND UNSUPPORTED :) I think the cooperative multitasking is a nice hack, though, and the HTTP server is a nice mechanism for controlling your Christmas light programs ;)

My current setup is two strings of G-35 lights (a 25-bulb and a 50-bulb), driven from an Arduino Mega 2560 with a WiFi shield.


Good technical overview for hacking the G-35 lights: http://www.deepdarc.com/2010/11/27/hacking-christmas-lights/
